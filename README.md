I am a current senior at Penn State University studying Data Science with a Computer Science focus. I'm set to graduate in December 2024. Over the past couple of years, I have experience working as a software engineer intern. I have attached links below to connect with me on various social media accounts that I have. In addition to that, the tools and technologies that I have been become learned and become comfortable with throughout my several internships and classes are displayed below. Links to the courses I have taken at Penn State as well as some projects I have completed both in school and out of school will be displayed on this page.
